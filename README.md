HEMA Tournament Organizer
=========================

This project aims to help the organization of HEMA tournaments by calculating the necessary match-ups,
tracking results and schedule matches, possibly spanning multiple tournaments.

## Structure

Currently, this project has two components.
Namely, [tournament-core](./tournament-core), which implements the tournament domain and core-logic, 
and [tournament-desktop](./tournament-desktop) a [Jetbrains Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/lp/compose-multiplatform/) desktop client.
